Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI using minimax algorithm

I designed this game to contain three difficulties that the player can choose from.

1- Easy: This was implemented using an AI that chooses a random move.

2- Medium: This AI was created to look for a winning move first and if not found it will look for a defensive move and if none is found it will play a random move.

3- Unbeatable!!!: Finally, I programmed this AI using the minimax algorithm.




##   Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. It uses recursion to search through the game-tree, and two players play the game in this algorithm, one is called MAX and the other is called MIN. This algorithm proceeds all the way down to the terminal node of the tree, then backtrack the tree as the recursion.
